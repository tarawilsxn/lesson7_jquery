### Project Description:

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A valuable lesson I learned in this assignment is how time efficient jQuery is versus javascript. With jQuery, it is so much faster and simpler to add behavior.
2. In this assignment I learned how to use the javascript console. In class I've used safari the whole time but for this assignment I did it in Chrome and I see how valuable the console is. 
3. Another thing I learned is that from now on I will always use jQuery to access content of a node because it is so much quicker.
